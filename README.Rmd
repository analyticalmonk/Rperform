# Rperform

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform/workflows/Check-RPerform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform/actions)

Rperform is a package that allows R developers to track quantitative performance metrics of their code. It focuses on providing changes in a package’s performance metrics, related to runtime and memory, over different git versions and across git branches. Rperform can be integrated with Travis-CI to do performance testing during Travis builds by making changes to the repo’s .travis.yml file. **It can prove to be particularly useful while measuring the possible changes which can be introduced by a pull request (PR).**

***For integrating Rperform with your travis build, check out the instructions provided on the [Rperform Wiki](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform/wiki/Integrating-Rperform-with-Travis-CI)***.

***For more information, tutorials and related blog posts, go through the [Rperform wiki](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform/wiki/Integrating-Rperform-with-Travis-CI).***

\*The project was initiated as a part of the [Google Summer of Code 2015](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki/Test-timings-on-Travis) program and accepted into [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/Rperform:-Performance-analysis-of-R-package-code) program.

\*The project has also been accepted into the [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/wiki/Rperform) program with [Toby Dylan Hocking](https://github.com/tdhock), [Akash Tandon](https://github.com/analyticalmonk) and [Randy Lai](mailto:randy.cs.lai@gmail.com) as the mentors.

# Installation

-   You can install the package from github using `devtools`\*.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("analyticalmonk/Rperform")
```

or,

``` r
devtools::install_github("analyticalmonk/Rperform")
```

# Basic examples

*For detailed information regarding Rperform’s plotting functions, check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform/wiki/Plotting-package-metrics-with-Rperform).*

**IMPORTANT**: The Rperform package requires you to set the current directory to the concerned git repository before using the functions.

``` r
> setwd(dir = "Path/to/repo")
```

-   The following example illustrates the use of the `Rperform::plot_metrics()` function on the git repository of the package [stringr](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/stringr).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
> setwd("./stringr")
> library(Rperform)
> plot_metrics(test_path = "inst/tests/test-join.r", metric = "time", num_commits = 10, save_data = FALSE, save_plots = FALSE)
```

![time plot](images/Rplot_time_updated.png)

-   The following example illustrates the use of the `Rperform::plot_branchmetrics()` function on the git repository of the package [stringr](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/stringr).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
> setwd("./stringr")
> library(Rperform)
> plot_branchmetrics(test_path = "inst/tests/test-interp.r", metric = "memory", branch1 = "rperform_test", branch2 = "master", save_data = F, save_plots = F)
```

![memory plot](images/Rplot_branchmem.jpeg)

-   The following example illustrates the use of the `Rperform::time_compare()` and `Rperform::mem_compare()` functions on the git repository of the package [stringr](https://github.com/EngineerDanny/stringr).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
> setwd("./stringr")
> library(Rperform)
> time_compare(test_path = "inst/tests/test-dup.r", num_commits = 2)
